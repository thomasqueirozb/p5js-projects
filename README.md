# Important

Some of these projects will **not** work if you open it as a file in the browser. If that happens you **must** run these files on a local server.

To set up a local server you can use python and connect to localhost:8000 in the browser.

For Python 3:

```sh
python3 -m http.server
```

For Python 2:

```sh
python2 -m SimpleHTTPServer
```
